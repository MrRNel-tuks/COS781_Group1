        "## Project Overview and Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook hosts the COS781 Group 1 study on accelerating association-rule mining for the Instacart transaction corpus. The workflow compares three pipelines—baseline Apriori, QR-reduced Apriori, and a hybrid QR+DHP variant—to determine how dimensionality reduction and candidate pruning affect runtime, memory, and rule quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What the Project Demonstrates\n",
        "- Baseline Apriori establishes the reference cost of mining rules on the full one-hot transaction matrix.\n",
        "- QR decomposition removes redundant product columns so Apriori explores a smaller item space.\n",
        "- Direct Hashing and Pruning (DHP) limits candidate generation and prunes infrequent transactions early.\n",
        "- The recorded metrics (runtime, RAM usage, rule count, average lift/confidence) quantify efficiency gains and any accuracy trade-offs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Optimization Techniques in This Project\n",
        "- **Sparse baskets**: Transactions are stored in SciPy CSR matrices, keeping only non-zero entries and cutting memory by orders of magnitude while enabling fast matrix ops.\n",
        "- **Hybrid dimensionality reduction**: QR column selection followed by optional PCA/SVD filters the feature space before Apriori explores it.\n",
        "- **Parallel workflows**: Heavy steps—SVD, customer scoring, and sparse filtering—invoke `joblib.Parallel` or multi-threaded BLAS so all CPU cores contribute.\n",
        "- **Candidate pruning**: DHP hashing trims low-frequency pairs early, shrinking each Apriori level.\n",
        "- **Streaming metrics**: Runtime and RAM tracking run alongside mining to capture cost/benefit for every configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Use This Notebook\n",
        "1. **Environment setup**: Install the dependencies listed below (Colab or local) and ensure the Instacart CSVs plus `kaggle.json` are accessible.\n",
        "2. **Data preparation**: Run the preparation cells to load, merge, and one-hot encode the orders → products mapping.\n",
        "3. **Choose experiments**: Execute the baseline, QR-only, and QR+DHP experiment runners. Adjust the QR threshold `gamma` values, sparsity filters, parallel worker counts, or DHP parameters as needed.\n",
        "4. **Review outputs**: Inspect the metrics table and plots to compare methods, then export the results for integration into the final report.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Resource Constraints & Sampling\n",
        "- **Default 20 000-order slice**: To stay within workstation RAM/CPU limits, all experiment modes currently run on a stratified sample. The pipeline can ingest the full dataset, but doing so requires cloud/GPU-class memory.\n",
        "- **Baseline vs. optimized**: Baseline Apriori uses that same 20 000 slice to make speedups directly comparable; QR-only and QR+DHP operate on identical rows before applying their reductions.\n",
        "- **Interpretation**: Treat the reported gains as conservative. With more memory, the same sparse + parallel tooling can extend the optimized pipelines to the full Instacart matrix.\n",

        "## 🧠 The Big Picture\n",
        "\n",
        "We treat the Instacart market-basket matrix as a massive, sparse signal. By compressing it with QR-driven column selection, pruning it with DHP hashing, and executing every heavy stage (sparse construction, SVD, rule mining) with multi-threaded primitives, we turn classical Apriori into a scalable analytics pipeline. The goal is to surface practically useful association rules while keeping runtime and memory proportional to the true number of purchases—not to the tens of thousands of potential products.\n"
