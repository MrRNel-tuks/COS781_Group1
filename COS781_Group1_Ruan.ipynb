        "🧠 The Big Picture\n",
        "\n",
        "You’re exploring how to make the Apriori algorithm faster and more scalable when dealing with huge, high-dimensional datasets — like the Instacart dataset (millions of orders, thousands of products).\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea:\n",
        "\n",
        "Apriori is powerful, but it slows down drastically when the number of features (items/products) explodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "So your group is testing two optimization strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "QR decomposition — reduce the number of attributes (columns) before Apriori.\n",
        "\n",
        "DHP (Direct Hashing and Pruning) — reduce the number of candidate sets Apriori generates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then you’ll combine both (Hybrid QR–DHP) and compare results.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚙️ The Three Experiments You’re Running\n",
        "1️⃣ Baseline Apriori\n",
        "\n",
        "What: The plain, original Apriori algorithm.\n",
        "Why: To serve as a reference point — you’ll measure how much faster or more efficient the improved methods are.\n",
        "\n",
        "What you’ll record:\n",
        "\n",
        "Runtime (how long it takes)\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory usage (RAM)\n",
        "\n",
        "Number of rules generated\n",
        "\n",
        "Rule quality: lift & confidence averages\n",
        "\n",
        "So basically:\n",
        "\n",
        "“How slow and heavy is the normal Apriori on this dataset?”\n",
        "\n",
        "2️⃣ QR-Reduced Apriori\n",
        "\n",
        "What: Before running Apriori, you apply QR decomposition to remove redundant columns (products) that are linearly dependent or highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why: To reduce dimensionality — fewer columns = fewer candidate sets = faster Apriori.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works (conceptually):\n",
        "\n",
        "You represent your transaction matrix as\n",
        "𝐴\n",
        "=\n",
        "𝑄\n",
        "𝑅\n",
        "A=QR\n",
        "\n",
        "𝑅\n",
        "R’s diagonal tells you which columns are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "You only keep columns where\n",
        "∣\n",
        "𝑅\n",
        "𝑖\n",
        "𝑖\n",
        "∣\n",
        ">\n",
        "𝛾\n",
        "∣R\n",
        "ii\n",
        "\t​\n",
        "\n",
        "∣>γ (a threshold between 0–1).\n",
        "\n",
        "The smaller the γ, the more columns you keep.\n",
        "\n",
        "You’ll try different γ values (e.g., 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and compare:\n",
        "\n",
        "How many columns were removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "How much faster Apriori becomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether the rule quality (lift/confidence) drops too much.\n",
        "\n",
        "So this answers:\n",
        "\n",
        "“How much efficiency can we gain from QR decomposition, and at what cost to accuracy?”\n",
        "\n",
        "3️⃣ QR + DHP Hybrid\n",
        "\n",
        "What: Combine the QR feature reduction and a modified version of Apriori called DHP (Direct Hashing and Pruning).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why: DHP improves Apriori by:\n",
        "\n",
        "Hashing candidate pairs into buckets (so it counts only promising itemsets).\n",
        "\n",
        "Pruning transactions and infrequent candidates early, saving time and memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "So now you test:\n",
        "\n",
        "“If we combine QR (fewer columns) with DHP (fewer candidate pairs), how much faster can we get — and do we still find good rules?”\n",
        "\n",
        "You’ll compare all three:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method\tQR Used?\tDHP Used?\tExpected Result\n",
        "Baseline Apriori\t❌\t❌\tSlowest, most rules\n",
        "QR-Only\t✅\t❌\tFaster, maybe fewer rules\n",
        "QR + DHP\t✅\t✅\tFastest, fewer but high-quality rules\n",
        "💻 What the Colab Code Does\n",
        "\n",
        "The framework I gave you is the experiment pipeline that automates all three tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s summarize each part:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Section\tWhat It Does\n",
        "Data Prep\tLoads the Instacart CSVs, merges them, one-hot encodes the transactions.\n",
        "Baseline Apriori\tRuns normal Apriori using mlxtend, logs runtime/memory.\n",
        "QR Feature Reduction\tApplies QR decomposition to shrink the dataset by removing redundant features.\n",
        "DHP (Placeholder)\tWhere you’ll add the hashing & pruning logic (for now, it just calls Apriori).\n",
        "Experiment Runner\tRuns all methods (Baseline, QR-only, QR+DHP) and records results in a table.\n",
        "Visualization\tPlots how runtime changes with different γ thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "So when you run the Colab:\n",
        "\n",
        "You load your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "You run all 3 methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "You get a table like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method\tGamma\t#Rules\tRuntime (s)\tMemory (MB)\n",
        "Baseline\t—\t1200\t85.3\t110.2\n",
        "QR-only\t0.5\t950\t47.6\t68.4\n",
        "QR-only\t0.7\t800\t32.9\t55.1\n",
        "QR+DHP\t0.7\t760\t28.2\t48.3\n",
        "\n",
        "And you’ll have plots showing how performance changes as γ increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "📊 After the Experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have these results:\n",
        "\n",
        "You’ll insert real numbers and graphs into your report.\n",
        "\n",
        "You’ll rewrite the “Evaluation” section with findings like:\n",
        "\n",
        "“Runtime decreased by 60% using QR-DHP.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Rule quality (lift/confidence) remained similar, showing minimal information loss.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Your Discussion & Conclusion become meaningful and evidence-backed.\n",
        "\n",
        "That’s what turns your paper from theoretical → empirical research."
